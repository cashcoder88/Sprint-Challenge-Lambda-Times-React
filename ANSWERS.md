- [ ] What are PropTypes used for? Please describe why it's important to type check our data in JavaScript.
- [ ] Describe a life-cycle event in React?
- [ ] Explain the details of a Higher Order Component?
- [ ] What are three different ways to style components in React? Explain some of the benefits of each.

1. Prop types is simply a way to typecheck for bugs by confirming in React that the props data we are passing is valid. If we need to make sure our 'x' prop is a string, we can set a proptype.string, etc, and debug our code!
2. A life-cycle event in react is one of the methods used under the hood in our 'life-cycle' process to make our components run properly. We can break down the life-cycle into three phases, the birth/mounting, the growth/updating, and the death/un-mounting phases!
3. A HOC, much like a higher order function, is a component that can take in other components as arguments, to give us much more advanced functionality in React. 
4. Three ways you could style in React would be Vanilla CSS, Sass, Or styled components. Sass is great because of nesting, vanilla is great if you really like to have style laid out line by line, and styled components are great if you want everything (functionality/styles) in one file.
